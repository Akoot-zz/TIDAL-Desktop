*TIDAL* Desktop Application for Linux which adds keyboard shortcuts such as play/pause in the background etc.

**Note:** Does not allow Hi-Fi+ Quality (It's playing on chromium...)
## Packaging
Package this application using [electron-packager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-packager)
by running `npm run package`

*I'm not affiliated with TIDAL in any way, I just made this quick because TIDAL does not have a Desktop application for Linux*
